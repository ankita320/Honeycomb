  <p class= "ankita7"> Hello! I am Ankita and I'm a rising 8th grader from NYC. I am a Kode with Klossy 2020 scholar. Some things to know about me are, I love bullet journaling, drawing, and some k-pop dancing. I love Kpop! Anyway, I started Kode with Klossy around two weeks ago, and somehow from that two week program- I'm here with my peers building a website. From the coding program I've learned so many things I never thought I'd be able to learn. I was able to learn javascript, making buttons do things, and so much more. I have found a new love for coding from this. There are so many programs like this where you have the opportunity to gain so much knowledge. However, sometimes, we just don't know about them. Through a quick google search, it may be challenging to find the coding program you prefer. Everything is so jumbled, with so much info all at once. The information isn't very narrowed therefore, making it difficult to find a coding program.  Another thing is that- there's the sterotype with women. "Women in tech?" "Women can't be working in the stem field." Those are all stereotypes. None of those things are true. I believe that women have the ability to take on the STEM field and be amazing at it.  In this website, you will find so many programs geared toward women. Also, you can actually find everything without anything being too crowded. Our purpose is to assist those trying to find the program for themselves. Buzz with impact. passion. empowerment. </p>

  <p class= "Rita2"> Hey! I'm Rita Chen, a rising Senior from NYC and a first time Kode with Klossy Scholar in Web Development. I'm so excited to be making something I'm passionate about come to life with coding! My team members and I all agreed how diffcult it was for us to find this coding camp. With HoneyComb, we hope to ensure that girls won't have to go through the long hours of research in search of STEM oppurtunities. We tried to comply a variety of resources that will continue to grow. I really hope every girl will feel empowered to become their own Queen Bee and be ready to buzz to make an impact in STEM!  </p>

  <img class="MarissaIcon" src="Marissa Icon Honeycomb.jpg" height= 400px >
  <p>Hi! My name is Marissa. I am currently a rising freshman in North New Jersey and a first-time Kode with Klossy scholar. A bit about me: I love music, and have an interest in anything science. My passions involve mainly food and travel.<br>I applied for Kode with Klossy because block coding wasn't cutting it for me. I knew what I wanted, but even then, it took me quite a while to find what I needed. The idea came from there, brought into reality by my two other team members with a similar idea. We hope you can use this to pursue your dreas in the STEM field, or to find yourself and your interests, like I still am. Good luck out there.</p>
